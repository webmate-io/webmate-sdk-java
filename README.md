# webmate Java SDK <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13346605" alt="webmate logo" width="28"/> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/webmate-io/webmate-sdk-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/webmate-io/webmate-sdk-java) ![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.testfabrik.webmate.sdk/java-sdk)

The webmate SaaS test automation platform provides testing services for testers and developers of web applications.
This SDK contains wrapper code used to call the webmate API from Java applications.

The webmate Java SDK is still under development and maintained regularly.
This release provides wrappers for the following tasks:

* Perform state extraction in an existing browser session, e.g. one that has been created via Selenium.
* Execute a new JobRun in the webmate Job service, e.g. to start a Job comparing the layout of web pages in multiple browsers.
* There is a convenience builder for a BrowserSessionCrossbrowserAnalysis job that may be used to compare the layout of states / web pages from multiple Selenium sessions.
* There is a convenience builder for a BrowserSessionRegressionAnalysis job that may be used to compare the layout of states / web pages from multiple Selenium sessions.

For a complete list of recent changes, please refer to the [changelog](CHANGES.md).

## webmate API

Although, the SDK provides a number of features and convenience wrappers it doesn't exhaust the full potential of the webmate API.
See the REST API [Swagger documentation](https://app.webmate.io/api/swagger) for a comprehensive summary of the webmate functionalities.
